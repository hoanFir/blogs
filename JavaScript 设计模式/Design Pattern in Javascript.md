## 一、What

In 1995, Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides published a book titled Design Patterns. This book catalogs the different ways objects can interact with each other and it created a common vocabulary around the different types of objects. 

**So, the blueprints for creating these different types of objects are called design patterns.**

## 二、Why

There are three main reasons why you would want to use design patterns in JavaScript:

- Maintainability(可维护性)

Design patterns help to keep your modules more loosely coupled(低耦合). This makes it easier to refactor your code and swap out different modules. It also makes ti easier to work in large teams and to collaborate with other programmers.


- Communication

 They give programmers shorthand for describing how their systems work. Instead of long explanations, 



- Performance
