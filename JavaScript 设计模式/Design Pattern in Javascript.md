In 1995, Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides published a book titled Design Patterns. This book catalogs the different ways objects can interact with each other and it created a common vocabulary around the different types of objects. The blueprints for creat- ing these different types of objects are called design patterns.
