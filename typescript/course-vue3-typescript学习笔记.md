## 1. Type Fundamentals

- common JavaScript types

string, number, boolean, array, function, object

```javascript

// adding the colon

let stageName: string = 'a vue';
let roomSize: number = 100;
let isOk: boolean = false;

```

- typescript provides additional types to javascript

**any**, which is essentially disables any type checking.

**tuple**, which is basically a fixed length array with predefined data types.

```javascript

// Example: RGB colors in a array
[number, number, number]

```

**enum**, which allows us to define friendly names to a set of values.


```javascript

enum ArrowKeys {
  Up,
  Down,
  Left,
  Right
 }
 
 // Up === 1, Down === 2, Left === 3, Right === 4

```
