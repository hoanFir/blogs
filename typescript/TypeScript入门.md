TypeScript is a programming language developed by Microsoft.

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript, and includes its own compiler.

Being a typed language, TypeScript can catch errors and bugs at build time, long before your app goes live.

To use TypeScript, you need to:

- add TypeScript as a dependency to project

- configure the TypeScript compiler options

- use the right file extensions

- add difinitions for libraries you use
