The `WebSocket` object provides the API for creating and managing a **WebSocket connection** to a server, as well as for sending and receiving data on the connection.

With WebSocket API, it is possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server. And we can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply.

tips: While a WebSocket connection is functionally somewhat similar to standard Unix-style sockets, they are not related.
