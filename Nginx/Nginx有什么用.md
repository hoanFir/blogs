**nginx is an `HTTP and reverse proxy server`, a `mail proxy server`, and a `generic TCP/UDP proxy server`.**

As we all known, Nginx can improve the `performance`(性能), `reliability`(可靠性), and `security`(安全性) of our applications.

Nginx has modernized full api lifecycle management. 

Traditional api management tools are complex and slow. Nginx is the most-trusted `api gateway`.

We can build a microservices to request router with Nginx Plus.

```
Nginx Plus: the only all-in-one load balancer, web server, content cache and api gateway.
```

We can deploy Nginx on any cloud, eliminate vendor lock‑in and reduce complexity.

- Security

We can prevents security breaches(防止安全漏洞) and limits malicious traffic(限制恶意流量) with Nginx Plus and the Nginx WAF.
