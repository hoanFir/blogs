Not all requests or packets carry an equal weight. Given this, round robin, or even the weighted(权重) round robin, will not fit the need of all applications or traffic flow. 

因此，NGINX 提供了许多负载平衡算法，用于适应特定的用例。

These load-balancing algorithms or methods can not only be chosen, but also configured. And they are available for upstream HTTP, TCP, and UDP pools:

## 一、Round robin



## 二、Least connections

## 三、Least time

## 四、Generic hash

## 五、IP hash
