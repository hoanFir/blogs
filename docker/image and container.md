Docker packages the application and its dependencies in an image file. Only through image file can generate Docker container, and start a server by running container.

The image file can be thought of as a template for the container. Docker generates an instance of the container from an image file. The same image file can generate multiple containers running at the same time.

Docker image is a binary file. In practice, an image file is often generated by inheriting another image file and adding some personalized settings. For example, you can on the basis of the image in the Ubuntu, to join the Apache server, form your image 🐂.

Docker image files are generic and can be copied from one machine to another. Generally speaking, in order to save time, we should try to use the image files made by others instead of making them ourselves. Even if it is to be customized, it should be processed based on someone else's image file, rather than made from scratch.

In order to sharing, the image file can be uploaded to the online warehouse. Docker Hub is the most important and commonly used image warehouse.
